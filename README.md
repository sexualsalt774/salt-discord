## Development

- **Commands** are located in `src/commands/`
- **Server logic** in `src/server.js` and `src/server.lua`
- **Client logic** in `src/client.lua`
- **Exports**: Lua and JS communicate via FiveM's `global.exports` and registered functions.

### Adding/Editing Commands

- Add new command files to `src/commands/`
- Each command exports a module with `name`, `description`, `options`, and `execute` function.

### Lua â†” JS Communication

- Lua functions are registered and called from JS using `global.exports[GetCurrentResourceName()]`
- See `src/server.lua` for registered functions like `fetchJobs`, `fetchCharacter`, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your bot token and client ID are correct in `server.cfg`
- Make sure the bot is invited to your Discord server with the correct permissions (slash commands, embeds)
- Check server console for errors if commands do not respond
